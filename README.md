# README #

11t is an iOS and Android app for connecting to [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon), written in FuseTools. In beta for both Android and iOS.

I connect to Mastodon on [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/), but everyone can start her own server. 11t let's you use any Mastodon instance.

### I hear there's a beta test? ###

You are absolutely right! I'm building this app from scratch, so please have some patience.

## iOS ##
If you use an Apple device, send me an e-mail at jeroen at jeroensmeets dot net. Important: I need you AppleID, i.e. the address that you use for logging into the App Store.

As long as there are spots open for the iOS test group, I'll add you to the beta group.

## Android ##
For Android, you can [visit this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.jeroensmeets.mastodon) on your mobile.

### How do I pronounce 11t? ###

Easy -- it's `elephan-t`.

### Build it yourself ###

You need the brilliant [FuseTools](https://www.fusetools.com/) and the code in this repository.

### Compliments ###

Font: [Noto](https://www.google.com/get/noto/).
